I was tired of some issues with other instant replay software so I created this to add some features to OBS replay buffer.

This includes: Notification noise and/or Notification popup on replay save. You can also click the popup to instantly play the clip. I also wanted this to open automatically on login so when the startup is enabled it also opens OBS with replay buffer and ignore shutdown warning. To automatically run the script on startup, select the option in the installer, or in the executable.

Only works with OBS Version <32.0.0 as a necessary tag was removed. please use [OBS 31.1.2](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/31.1.2).
If you're working with the python, it works with Python 3.11, there are two automatic package downloads.

You can set your preferences in the BetterReplayBuffer executable.

I recommend setting a default scene so the right one is picked on startup.
